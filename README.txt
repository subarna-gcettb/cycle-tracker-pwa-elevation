CycleTrack â€” PWA (HTML/CSS/JS)
--------------------------------
This is a simple progressive web app to track cycling rides using the browser's Geolocation API and Leaflet/OpenStreetMap for maps.
Files included:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
- manifest.json
- sw.js
- icon-192.png, icon-512.png

Notes & usage:
- For geolocation and service workers to work, use HTTPS or run via localhost.
- Open index.html in a modern mobile browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox). Allow location access and high accuracy.
- Click "Start Ride" to begin; "Stop Ride" to finish. Save ride to store it locally and export GPX files.
- You can install the app using the browser's install prompt (or the "Install" button when shown).

Developed for Subarna as a starter PWA cycling tracker.
